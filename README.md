stroke_prediction_dataset_and_WorkBook
In this folder the raw dataset and workbook in excel is given. In raw data various information such as person's  id	,gender	,age	,hypertension	,heart_disease	,ever_married,	work_type,	Residence_type	,avg_glucose_level,	bmi	,smoking_status	,stroke are given. So I analysed and applied Logostic regression to predict Stroke for new Unseen data . 
following Tasks have been done:
1. Data cleaning
2. Imputation for missing values
3. Outlier calculation
4. Exploratory data analysis -EDA ( Univariate and bivariate )
5. Correlation and Chi- Square test for checking indenpendecy of variables 
6. One-hot encoding for categorical features
7. Applied logistic Model for prediction 
8. Calculated Confusion matrix and checked model accurary ,recall & precision and checked model Performance.
9. draw ROC curve
